# General troubleshooting

## OpenOCD problems

### can't connect to OpenOCD - "Error: open failed"

#### Symptoms

Upon trying to establish a *new connection* with the device you get an error
that looks like this:

```
$ openocd -f (..)
(..)
Error: open failed
in procedure 'init'
in procedure 'ocd_bouncer'
```

#### Cause

The device is not (properly) connected or not the correct ST-LINK interface
configuration is used.

#### Fix

Linux:

- Check the USB connection using `lsusb`.
- You may not have enough permission to open the device. Try again with `sudo`.
  If that works, you can use [these instructions] to make OpenOCD work without
  root privilege.
- You might be using the wrong interface configuration for your ST-LINK.
  Try `interface/stlink-v2.cfg` instead of `interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg`.

[these instructions]: ../../03-setup/linux.md#udev-rules

Windows:

- You are probably missing the ST-LINK USB driver. Installation instructions
  [here].

### can't connect to OpenOCD - "Polling again in X00ms"

#### Symptoms

Upon trying to establish a *new connection* with the device you get an error
that looks like this:

```
$ openocd -f (..)
(..)
Error: jtag status contains invalid mode value - communication failure
Polling target stm32f3x.cpu failed, trying to reexamine
Examination failed, GDB will be halted. Polling again in 100ms
Info : Previous state query failed, trying to reconnect
Error: jtag status contains invalid mode value - communication failure
Polling target stm32f3x.cpu failed, trying to reexamine
Examination failed, GDB will be halted. Polling again in 300ms
Info : Previous state query failed, trying to reconnect
```

#### Cause

The microcontroller may have get stuck in some tight infinite loop or it may be
continuously raising an exception, e.g. the exception handler is raising an
exception.

#### Fix

- Close OpenOCD, if running
- Press and hold the reset (black) button
- Launch the OpenOCD command
- Now, release the reset button


### OpenOCD connection lost - "Polling again in X00ms"

#### Symptoms

A *running* OpenOCD session suddenly errors with:

```
# openocd -f (..)
Error: jtag status contains invalid mode value - communication failure
Polling target stm32f3x.cpu failed, trying to reexamine
Examination failed, GDB will be halted. Polling again in 100ms
Info : Previous state query failed, trying to reconnect
Error: jtag status contains invalid mode value - communication failure
Polling target stm32f3x.cpu failed, trying to reexamine
Examination failed, GDB will be halted. Polling again in 300ms
Info : Previous state query failed, trying to reconnect
```

#### Cause

The USB connection was lost.

#### Fix

- Close OpenOCD
- Disconnect and re-connect the USB cable.
- Re-launch OpenOCD

### Can't flash the device - "Ignoring packet error, continuing..."

#### Symptoms

While flashing the device, you get:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb $file
Start address 0x8000194, load size 31588
Transfer rate: 22 KB/sec, 5264 bytes/write.
Ignoring packet error, continuing...
Ignoring packet error, continuing...
```

#### Cause

Closed `itmdump` while a program that "printed" to the ITM was running. The
current GDB session will appear to work normally, just without ITM output but
the next GDB session will error with the message that was shown in the previous
section.

Or, `itmdump` was called **after** the `monitor tpiu` was issued thus making
`itmdump` delete the file / named-pipe that OpenOCD was writing to.

#### Fix

- Close/kill GDB, OpenOCD and `itmdump`
- Remove the file / named-pipe that `itmdump` was using (for example,
  `itm.txt`).
- Launch OpenOCD
- Then, launch `itmdump`
- Then, launch the GDB session that executes the `monitor tpiu` command.


### can't connect to OpenOCD - "Error: couldn't bind [telnet] to socket: Address already in use"

#### Symptoms

Upon trying to establish a *new connection* with the device you get an error
that looks something like this:

```
$ openocd -f (..)
(..)
Error: couldn't bind telnet to socket: Address already in use
```

#### Cause

One or more of the ports OpenOCD requires access to, 3333, 4444, or 6666, is in use by another process. Each of these ports is used for another aspect: 3333 for gdb, 4444 for telnet, 6666 for remote procedure call (RPC) commands to TCL

#### Fix

You can go two routes for fixing this. A) Kill any process that's using one of those ports. B) Specify different ports you know to be free for OpenOCD to use.

Solution A

Mac:
- Get a list of processes using ports by running `sudo lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`
- Kill the process(es) blocking the key ports by noting their pid(s) and running `kill [pid]` for each. (Assuming you can confirm they're not running anything mission-critical on your machine!)

Solution B

All:
- Send configuration details to OpenOCD when starting it up so that it uses a different port from the default for any of the processes.
- For example, to do its telnet features on 4441 instead of the default 4444, you would run `openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg -c "telnet_port 4441"`
- More details on OpenOCD's Configuration Stage can be found in their [official docs online](http://openocd.org/doc/html/Server-Configuration.html).


## Cargo problems

### "can't find crate for `core`"

#### Symptoms

```
   Compiling volatile-register v0.1.2
   Compiling rlibc v1.0.0
   Compiling r0 v0.1.0
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`

error: aborting due to previous error

error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`

error: aborting due to previous error

error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`

error: aborting due to previous error

Build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
Build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: Could not compile `r0`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

#### Cause

You are using a toolchain older than `nightly-2018-04-08` and forgot to call `rustup target add
thumbv7em-none-eabihf`.

#### Fix

Update your nightly and install the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target.

``` console
$ rustup update nightly

$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Kernel problems

### lsusb don't show STM32F after STM32F got stuck, even reconnect

#### Symptoms

Sometime you might make STM32 freeze, and it lost connect even if you reconnect the USB

and got something like these in `dmesg`:

```
[  700.256746] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
[  700.260711] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
[  700.260711] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: HC died; cleaning up
```

#### Cause

STM32 got freezed, kernel can not get the response from it, so remove it.
Reconnect USB port won't make kernet to try connect it again.

#### Fix

Linux:

- Get the ID from `dmesg`, the id is "0000:06:00.4" for below example:

```
[  700.256746] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
[  700.260711] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
[  700.260711] xhci_hcd 0000:06:00.4: HC died; cleaning up
```

- go to `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/`
- unbind it with ID, `echo -n "0000:06:00.4" > unbind`
- rebind it, `echo -n "0000:06:00.4" > bind`
