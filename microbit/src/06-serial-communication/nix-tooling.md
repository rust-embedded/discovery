## Connecting the micro:bit board

If you connect the micro:bit board to your computer you
should see a new TTY device appear in `/dev`.

``` console
$ # Linux
$ dmesg | grep -i tty
[63712.446286] cdc_acm 1-1.7:1.1: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
```

This is the USB <-> Serial device. On Linux, it's named `tty*` (usually
`ttyACM*` or `ttyUSB*`).
On Mac OS `ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*` will show the serial device.

But what exactly is `ttyACM0`? It's a file of course!
Everything is a file in \*nix:

```
$ ls -l /dev/ttyACM0
crw-rw----. 1 root plugdev 166, 0 Jan 21 11:56 /dev/ttyACM0
```

You can send out data by simply writing to this file:

``` console
$ echo 'Hello, world!' > /dev/ttyACM0
```

You should see the orange LED on the micro:bit, right next to the USB port, blink for a moment,
whenever you enter this command.

## minicom

We'll use the program `minicom` to interact with the serial device using the keyboard.

We must configure `minicom` before we use it. There are quite a few ways to do that but we'll use a
`.minirc.dfl` file in the home directory. Create a file in `~/.minirc.dfl` with the following
contents:

``` console
$ cat ~/.minirc.dfl
pu baudrate 115200
pu bits 8
pu parity N
pu stopbits 1
pu rtscts No
pu xonxoff No
```

> **NOTE** Make sure this file ends in a newline! Otherwise, `minicom` will fail to read it.

That file should be straightforward to read (except for the last two lines), but nonetheless let's
go over it line by line:

- `pu baudrate 115200`. Sets baud rate to 115200 bps.
- `pu bits 8`. 8 bits per frame.
- `pu parity N`. No parity check.
- `pu stopbits 1`. 1 stop bit.
- `pu rtscts No`. No hardware control flow.
- `pu xonxoff No`. No software control flow.

Once that's in place, we can launch `minicom`.

``` console
$ # NOTE you may need to use a different device here
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
```

This tells `minicom` to open the serial device at `/dev/ttyACM0` and set its
baud rate to 115200. A text-based user interface (TUI) will pop out.

You can now send data using the keyboard! Go ahead and type something. Note that
the text UI will *not* echo back what you type. If you pay attention to the yellow LED
on top of the micro:bit though, you will notice that it blinks whenever you type something.

## `minicom` commands

`minicom` exposes commands via keyboard shortcuts. On Linux, the shortcuts start with `Ctrl+A`. On
Mac, the shortcuts start with the `Meta` key. Some useful commands below:

- `Ctrl+A` + `Z`. Minicom Command Summary
- `Ctrl+A` + `C`. Clear the screen
- `Ctrl+A` + `X`. Exit and reset
- `Ctrl+A` + `Q`. Quit with no reset

> **NOTE** Mac users: In the above commands, replace `Ctrl+A` with `Meta`.
