# Send a string

The next task will be to send a whole string from the micro to your laptop.

I want you to send the string `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`
from the micro to your laptop.

It's your turn to write the program.

Execute your program inside the debugger, statement by statement. What do you
see?

Then execute the program in "one go" using the `continue` command. What happens
this time?

Finally, build the program in "release" mode and, again, run it "one go". What
happens this time?
