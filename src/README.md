# `Discovery`

Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

There are currently two versions of this book. The first is older and uses an
F3 Discovery circuit board to introduce you to microcontrollers and Rust, while
the second is newer and uses a micro:bit circuit board instead.

- [Read the newer book, using a micro:bit](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit)
